# Pacman

This is game Pacman implemented in Java Swing during the course of Graphical User Interfaces at PJAIT.


**The conditions were:**
* to have menues New Game, High Scores, and Exit
* the player would be able to choose the size of the playing field
* own implementation of JTable and CellRenderer
* all moments related to time must be implemented using Threads
* Implement the possibility of interrupting the game using the shortcut of Control+Shift+Q
* the window must be scalable
* not using GIF-s

my additions:

**by eating a big pill, a couple of things can happen to Pac-Man:**
--change of Pacman's speed
--change of Ghost's speed
--teleportation
--inversion of keys (e.g. Pac-Man will go up by pressing key down)
--change of Ghost's color
**During the creation of the labyrinth, DFS algorithm was used**
**After loss, the player's score is written to the file**
