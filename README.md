# Pacman

This is game Pacman implemented in Java Swing during course of Graphical User Interfaces at PJAIT.
the conditions were:
to have menu New Game, High Scores and Exit
player would be able to choose size of playing field
own implementation of JTable and CellRenderer
all moments related to time must be implemented using Threads
implement possiblility to interrupt the game using shortcut of Control+Shift+Q
window must be scalable
not using GIF-s

my additions:
**by eating big pill a couple of things can happen to Pacman:**
  change of Pacman's speed
  change of Ghost's speed
  teleportation
  inversion of keys (e.g. pacman will go up by pressing key down)
  change of Ghost's color
**during creation of labyrint DFS algorithm was used**
**after loss player's score is written to the file**
